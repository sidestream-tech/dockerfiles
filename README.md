# Dockerfiles

Repository for a collection of `Dockerfile`s that have helped us during development and during projects. Useful for local development, deployments and CI/CD pipelines.

Currently, we offer:
- `python-poetry`: Where `poetry` is the amazing [python package manager](https://python-poetry.org/). So far other images we found were outdated and unmaintained. We recommend to use [`acidrain`'s](https://hub.docker.com/u/acidrain) `Dockerfile`s [`python-poetry`](https://hub.docker.com/r/acidrain/python-poetry). They are very good ðŸ™‚
    - image name example: `acidrain/python-poetry:3.9-slim`
- `ci-cd/aws-cli-chamber-helm`: `aws-cli` + `chamber`  + `helm` images and files in order to support our continuous delivery, where:
    - `aws-cli` is used to connect to AWS infrastructure
    - `chamber` is used to securely inject secrets into the deployment,
    - `helm` is used to deploy the application
    - image name: `sidestream/aws-cli-chamber-helm`
- `ci-cd/aws-cli-chamber-helmsman`: `aws-cli` + `chamber`  + `helm` + `helmsman`  images and files in order to support our continuous delivery, where:
    - `aws-cli` is used to connect to AWS infrastructure
    - `chamber` is used to securely inject secrets into the deployment,
    - `helm` is used to deploy the application
    - `helmsman` is used as a desired state file tooling for helm
    - image name: `sidestream/aws-cli-chamber-helmsman`
- `ci-cd/docker-in-docker-chamber`: Docker-in-docker (dind) and `chamber` for docker build time configuration injection in CI/CD pipeline
    - image name: `sidestream/docker-in-docker-chamber`

You can find and pull [the images on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sidestream).
