# Dockerfiles

Repository for a collection of `Dockerfile`s that have helped us during development and during projects. Useful for local development, deployments and CI/CD pipelines.

Currently, we only offer public `python-poetry` images and files, where `poetry` is the amazing [python package manager](https://python-poetry.org/). So far other images we found were outdated and unmaintained. We wanted to change that, as we believe in `poetry` as the future oof python package management.

You can find and pull [the images on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sidestream/python-poetry).
